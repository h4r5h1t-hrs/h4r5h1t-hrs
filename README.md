## 👽 wh04m1 ? 🤔 💖

My name is **Harshit Raj Singh**, but you can call me **G!2m0** 👨‍💻. I am a Security & Automation Engineer 💻 from planet Cybersecurity 🌏, here to protect the digital realm from all kinds of threats. With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering 🎓 under my belt, I am well-versed in Security Automation, Application Security, and Penetration Testing. 

My goal is to use my skills to automate tedious tasks and make a positive impact on the infosec community 🌐.

</p>

- ✔️ Security Automation (to protect the galaxy) <br>
- ✔️ Application Security (to secure alien invasions) <br>
- ✔️ Penetration Testing (to infiltrate the enemy's base) <br>
- ✔️ IT Support & Automation (to keep my spaceship running) <br>
- ✔️ Network Security (to protect my communication with HQ) <br>
- ✔️ OSINT (to gather intel on the enemy) <br>

I am proficient in several languages including Python, Shell Scripting, HTML, and CSS, and have basic knowledge of JavaScript, C/C++, and Golang. I have experience working with Linux (Kali, Ubuntu, Fedora) and Windows operating systems and am familiar with a range of tools such as Nmap, Burpsuite, Maltego, Wireshark, CISCO Packet Tracer and more. I have also helped in implementing CI/CD in my company and have written test cases for the projects.

In addition to my technical skills, I have experience with version control using Git and GitHub and have worked with Selenium, Docker, WordPress, and Elementor. I am familiar with the Agile Methodology (Scrum) and enjoy participating in various labs on [TryHackMe](https://www.tryhackme.com/p/h4r5h1t.hrs) and [PortSwigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security/) to sharpen my skills and prepare for any cyber battles.

When I'm not busy securing the interwebs, you can find me binge-watching 📺 the latest anime releases or reading 📖 the latest manga, manhwa or manhua.
You can stay updated on my anime journey by following me on [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/profile/G12m0x19) and [Anilist](https://anilist.co/user/G12M0X19/), where I keep track of everything I've watched or read and rate them accordingly. I'm always on the lookout for new and exciting anime and manga to add to my list, so don't hesitate to send me a recommendation.

I may be a total otaku at heart, but don't let my love for anime fool you, when it comes to cybersecurity, I am all business. I stay sharp by keeping up with the latest developments and trends in the field, and I also share my knowledge and insights with others through my writing on [Medium](https://h4r5h1t-hrs.medium.com/).

Not only that, I also contribute to open-source community by creating security tools that can help others protect their digital assets. You can check out my public repository on GitHub, leave me a star if you find any of my projects useful, and follow my [GitHub](https://github.com/h4r5h1t-hrs) profile to see my progress and join me on my journey to save the galaxy from cyber threats!🚀
